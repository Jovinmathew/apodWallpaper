# Application Layer

The Application layer acts as a mediator between the Domain layer and the outer layers (Presentation and Infrastructure). It implements the use cases defined in the Domain layer and coordinates the flow of data to and from the outer layers.

### APOD

The `apod` folder contains classes related to managing the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) feature:

- `apod_service.dart`: This file contains the `ApodService` class, which implements the use cases related to fetching and managing APOD data, such as `GetApodForDate`, `GetRandomApod`, and `SaveApodAsWallpaper`. It acts as a facade for the APOD-related use cases and handles any necessary data transformations or additional logic.

- `apod_state.dart`: This file defines a state management class (e.g., using the BLoC pattern) to manage the state of the APOD feature in the app, such as loading, error, and success states.

### Favorites

The `favorites` folder contains classes related to managing the user's favorite APODs:

- `favorites_service.dart`: This file contains the `FavoritesService` class, which implements the use cases related to managing the user's favorite APODs, such as `ToggleFavoriteApod` and `GetFavoriteApods`.

- `favorites_state.dart`: Similar to `apod_state.dart`, this file defines a state management class for the favorites feature.

## Dependencies

The Application layer depends on the Domain layer to access the use cases and entities defined in the Domain layer. It also depends on the Infrastructure layer to interact with external systems, such as APIs or databases, through the repositories implemented in the Infrastructure layer.

## Testing

The classes in the Application layer can be unit tested to ensure the correct implementation of the use cases and the proper coordination of data flow between the Domain and Infrastructure layers. However, since the Application layer depends on the Infrastructure layer, some dependencies may need to be mocked or stubbed during testing.
