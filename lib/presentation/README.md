# Presentation Layer

The Presentation layer is responsible for handling the user interface and user interactions in the Wallpaper app. It contains the UI components, view models, and other presentation logic. This layer depends on the Application layer to execute the business logic and access the application's use cases.

### Blocs

The `blocs` folder contains the implementation of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management in the app. It is organized into subfolders for different features or domains:

- `apod/`: Contains the `ApodBloc`, `ApodEvent`, and `ApodState` classes for managing the state and events related to the APOD feature.
- `favorites/`: Contains the `FavoritesBloc`, `FavoritesEvent`, and `FavoritesState` classes for managing the state and events related to the user's favorite APODs.

### Pages

The `pages` folder contains the main screens or pages of the app:

- `home_page.dart`: The main home screen of the app, where users can view the current APOD and access other features.
- `details_page.dart`: A details screen that displays more information about a specific APOD.
- `favorites_page.dart`: A screen that displays the user's favorite APODs.

### Widgets

The `widgets` folder contains reusable UI components used throughout the app:

- `apod_card.dart`: A widget that displays a card-like view of an APOD, potentially used in multiple places within the app.
- `favorites_list.dart`: A widget that displays a list of the user's favorite APODs.

## Dependencies

The Presentation layer depends on the Application layer to access the application's use cases and services. It may also depend on external UI libraries or packages, such as the BLoC library for state management or other Flutter packages for UI components or animations.

## Testing

The UI components and view models in the Presentation layer can be unit tested to ensure their correct behavior and interactions with the Application layer. However, some dependencies on the Application layer or external UI libraries may need to be mocked or stubbed during testing.

Additionally, integration tests can be written to test the end-to-end user flows and interactions within the app, ensuring that the different layers work together correctly.
