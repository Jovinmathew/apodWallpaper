# Domain Layer

## Domain

### Definition
The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined.
In software architecture, the Domain layer represents the core business logic and rules of an application. It encapsulates the entities, use cases, and repository interfaces that define the application's domain, independent of any external dependencies or implementation details.

### Examples
- In an e-commerce application, the Domain layer would include entities like Product, Order, and Customer, along with use cases for managing orders, handling payments, and updating inventory.
- In a social media app, the Domain layer might contain entities like User, Post, and Comment, with use cases for creating posts, liking content, and managing user profiles.

## Folder Structure

domain/
├── entities/
├── repositories/
└── use_cases/

### Entities

The `entities` folder contains the core business models or objects of the application. Currently, it includes:

- `apod.dart`: Represents the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) entity, containing properties like title, description, image URL, and date.

### Repositories

The `repositories` folder defines the interfaces for data access and persistence operations. It abstracts the data source away from the use cases, allowing the business logic to remain independent of the actual data implementation. Currently, it includes:

- `apod_repository.dart`: Defines the `ApodRepository` interface with methods for fetching APOD data and saving APOD images as wallpapers.

### Use Cases

The `use_cases` folder contains the application's business logic and governs the interactions between entities. Each use case encapsulates a specific operation or action that can be performed in the application. Currently, it includes:

- `get_apod_for_date.dart`: Defines the `GetApodForDate` use case, which retrieves the APOD data for a given date by interacting with the `ApodRepository`.
- `save_apod_as_wallpaper.dart`: Defines the `SaveApodAsWallpaper` use case, which saves an APOD image as a wallpaper on the device by interacting with the `ApodRepository`.

## Dependencies

The Domain layer has no external dependencies and should not depend on any outer layers or external libraries. It follows the Dependency Rule of Clean Architecture, ensuring that the core business logic remains independent and isolated from external concerns.

## Testing

The entities, use cases, and repository interfaces in the Domain layer should be thoroughly unit tested to ensure the correctness of the business logic. Since the Domain layer is independent of external dependencies, unit testing can be performed without relying on external systems or mocking complex dependencies.
